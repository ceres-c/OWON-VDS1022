# OWON VDS1022/I Oscilloscope

This software is an unofficial release for the OWON VDS oscilloscope with a few improvements:

* Scripts to install the app on Linux/Windows/Mac
* New shortcuts: single trigger, trigger level, offsets, coupling, inversion, reset ...
* Added buttons to change the color of the waves
* Improved the dock layout and disabled animations
* Improved the device stability
* Disabled the leave/stop confirmation while recording/playing
* Merged the save image / export operation to a single button/dialog
* Many fixes (see change list)


This software is based on the OWON release for VDS1022/I 1.0.30 :

https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html  


## Install

Download and extract the following archive:  

https://github.com/florentbr/OWON-VDS1022/archive/master.zip  

#### Windows

Right click on `install-win.cmd` and select "Run as administrator".  
The script installs the drivers, copies the files, registers for uninstall and creates a menu entry.  
User settings are stored in `%APPDATA%\OwonVdsTiny`  

#### Linux (generic)

Open a terminal window and execute `sudo bash install-linux.sh` .  
The script builds a package according to the distribution and installs it with the default package manager.  
User settings are stored in `$Home/.owon-vds-tiny`  

#### Arch Linux

A package is avaialbe in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/) as [`owon-vds`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/owon-vds/)

#### OSX

Open a terminal window and execute `sudo bash install-mac.sh` .  
The script simply creates/copies the files into `/Applications` .  
User settings are stored in `$Home/.owon-vds-tiny`  


## Calibration

The device can be calibrated either automatically (Home/Utility/Auto-Calibrate) or manually (F2).

If you wish to calibrate the device manually then:
* Disconnect the probes
* Select a x1 ratio and a DC coupling for each probe 
* Select the targeted voltage to calibrate
* Move the voltage offset to 0 volts
* Adjust the Zero compensation to align the signal with the cursor
* Move the voltage offset to the top
* Adjust the Zero amplitude to align the signal with the cursor
* Connect the probe to a reference voltage
* Adjust the Coarse Gain until the signal has the expected amplitude

The factory calibration is stored directly in the device.  
The current calibration is stored in the user folder.
